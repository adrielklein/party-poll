    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever needed to take a poll in Slack? There are apps like Simple
      Poll but it costs money
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you created an emoji poll as described on the
      <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-"
        >slack docs</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty straightforward but annoying to manually type in all the emoji
      options.
    </p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Party poll is the best of both worlds by allow users to create an emoji
      based reaction poll with a single slash command
    </p>
    <p>Why poll when you can Party Poll? ðŸŽ‰</p>
